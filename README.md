## Hero Section Design
The hero section is a pivotal part of our design, split into two distinct parts:

1. **Left Section:** This part contains [specific content details - e.g., introductory text, call-to-action buttons].
2. **Right Section:** This part showcases [specific content - e.g., images, interactive elements].

### Loader Animation
- **Description:** The loader animation is a unique aspect of the hero section. It appears while the content is loading and disappears once loading is complete.
- **Implementation Details:** [Details about how the loader is implemented, its design specifics].

### Button Interactions
- **Hover Animations:** Each button in the hero section has a distinct hover animation. [Describe the nature of these animations].
- **Implementation:** To understand the implementation, refer to the Components page in the Figma file.
